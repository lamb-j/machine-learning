CIS 572, Fall 2016, University of Oregon

This repository contains materials used in the Fall 2016 Machine Learning course (572). We covered a breadth of machine learning techniques, with an emphasis on the mathematical and statistical justification for each method. Much of the written homework was completed on paper, and so absent from this repository.

## Contents

* ./hw - Homework assignments completed using Latex documents and python scripts
* ./notes - In class notes recorded
* ./final_project - Final project for the course. This project used a large data set of match data for the popular League of Legends computer game. I used decision trees and a random forest approach to predict game outcomes using only data from the first 10 minutes of a match. See ./final_project/ML_paper.pdf for a detailed description of this project.
* ./README.md - This file

## Built With

* [python]() - Language used for implementing ML algorithms
* [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - Machine Learning library used for final project
