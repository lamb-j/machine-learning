Coniserations:
  The performance of teams may not be comparable across teirs. For example, the creep
	kills by the losing team in a Diamond tier game will likely be signficantly higher
	than the creep kills by the winning team in a Gold tier game.

	However this may just lead to some acceptable inaccuarcies the model

To Do:
 
  1. Get 10 minute data

	2. Make models all the way through
